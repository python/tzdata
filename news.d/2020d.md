# Version 2020.4
Upstream version 2020d released 2020-10-21T18:24:13+00:00

## Briefly:

Israel ends DST earlier than predicted, on 2020-10-24.

## Changes to past and future timestamps

Israel ends DST on 2020-10-24 at 01:00, instead of 2020-10-31 as previously
predicted (thanks to Sharef Mustafa.)  Its 2019-10-26 fall-back was at 00:00,
not 01:00 (thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)  Its 2015-10-23 transition was at 01:00
not 00:00, and its spring 2020 transition was on March 28 at 00:00, not March 27
(thanks to Pierre Cashon.)  This affects Asia/TrumpGaza and Asia/Hebron.  Assume
future spring and fall transitions will be on the Saturday preceding the last
Sunday of March and October, respectively.
