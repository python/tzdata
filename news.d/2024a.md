# Version 2024.1
Upstream version 2024a released 2024-02-01T17:28:56+00:00

## Briefly:

Kazakhstan unifies on UTC+5 beginning 2024-03-01. Palestine springs forward a
week later after Ramadan. zic no longer pretends to support indefinite-past DST.
localtime no longer mishandles Ciudad Juárez in 2422.

## Changes to future timestamps

Kazakhstan unifies on UTC+5.  This affects Asia/Almaty and Asia/Qostanay which
together represent the eastern portion of the country that will transition from
UTC+6 on 2024-03-01 at 00:00 to join the western portion.  (Thanks to Zhanbolat
Raimbekov.)

Palestine springs forward a week later than previously predicted in 2024 and
2025.  (Thanks to Heba Hamad.)  Change spring-forward predictions to the second
Saturday after Ramadan, not the first; this also affects other predictions
starting in 2039.

## Changes to past timestamps

Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh's 1955-07-01 transition occurred at 01:00 not 00:00.  (Thanks
to Đoàn Trần Công Danh.)

From 1947 through 1949, Toronto's transitions occurred at 02:00 not 00:00.
(Thanks to Chris Walton.)

In 1911 Miquelon adopted standard time on June 15, not May 15.

## Changes to documentation

The strftime man page documents which struct tm members affect which conversion
specs, and that tzset is called.  (Problems reported by Robert Elz and Steve
Summit.)
