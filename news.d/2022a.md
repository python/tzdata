# Version 2022.1
Upstream version 2022a released 2022-03-16T06:02:01+00:00

## Briefly:

Israel will spring forward on 2022-03-27, not -03-26. zdump -v now outputs
better failure indications. Bug fixes for code that reads corrupted TZif data.

## Changes to future timestamps

Israel will spring forward on 2022-03-27, not 2022-03-26. (Thanks to Heba
Hamad.)  Predict future transitions for first Sunday >= March 25.  Additionally,
predict fallbacks to be the first Friday on or after October 23, not October's
last Friday, to be more consistent with recent practice.  The first differing
fallback prediction is on 2025-10-24, not 2025-10-31.

## Changes to past timestamps

From 1992 through spring 1996, Ukraine's DST transitions were at 02:00 standard
time, not at 01:00 UTC.  (Thanks to Alois Treindl.)

Chile's Santiago Mean Time and its LMT precursor have been adjusted eastward by
1 second to align with past and present law.

## Changes to commentary

Add several references for Chile's 1946/1947 transitions, some of which only
affected portions of the country.
