# Version 2025.3
Upstream version 2025c released 2025-12-10T22:42:37+00:00

## Briefly:

Several code changes for compatibility with FreeBSD.

## Changes to past timestamps

Baja California agreed with California’s DST rules in 1953 and in 1961 through
1975, instead of observing standard time all year. (Thanks to Alois Treindl.)

## Changes to commentary

The leapseconds file contains commentary about the IERS and NIST last-modified
and expiration timestamps for leap second data. (Thanks to Judah Levine.)

Commentary now also uses characters from the set –‘’“”•≤ as this can be useful
and should work with current applications.  This also affects data in
iso3166.tab and zone1970.tab, which now contain strings like “Côte d’Ivoire”
instead of “Côte d'Ivoire”.
