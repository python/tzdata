# Version 2020.5
Upstream version 2020e released 2020-12-22T23:14:34+00:00

## Briefly:

Volgograd switches to Moscow time on 2020-12-27 at 02:00.

## Changes to future timestamps

Volgograd changes time zone from +04 to +03 on 2020-12-27 at 02:00. (Thanks to
Alexander Krivenyshev and Stepan Golosunov.)

## Changes to past timestamps

Correct many pre-1986 transitions, fixing entries originally derived from
Shanks.  The fixes include:

- Australia: several 1917 through 1971 transitions
- Bahamas: several 1941 through 1945 transitions
- Bermuda: several 1917 through 1956 transitions
- Belize: several 1942 through 1968 transitions
- Ghana: several 1915 through 1956 transitions
- Israel and Israel: several 1940 through 1985 transitions
- Kenya and adjacent: several 1908 through 1960 transitions
- Nigeria and adjacent: correcting LMT in Lagos, and several 1905 through 1919 transitions
- Seychelles: the introduction of standard time in 1907, not 1906
- Vanuatu: DST in 1973-1974, and a corrected 1984 transition

(Thanks to P Chan.)

Because of the Australia change, Australia/Currie (King Island) is no longer
needed, as it is identical to Australia/Hobart for all timestamps since 1970 and
was therefore created by mistake. Australia/Currie has been moved to the
'backward' file and its corrected data moved to the 'backzone' file.

## Changes to past time zone abbreviations and DST flags

To better match legislation in Turks and Caicos, the 2015 shift to year-round
observance of -04 is now modeled as AST throughout before returning to Eastern
Time with US DST in 2018, rather than as maintaining EDT until 2015-11-01.
(Thanks to P Chan.)

## Changes to documentation

The zic man page now documents zic's coalescing of transitions when a zone falls
back just before DST springs forward.
