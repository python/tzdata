# Version 2022.4
Upstream version 2022d released 2022-09-23T19:02:57+00:00

## Briefly:

Israel transitions are now Saturdays at 02:00. Simplify three Ukraine zones
into one.

## Changes to future timestamps

Israel now springs forward and falls back at 02:00 on the first Saturday on
or after March 24 and October 24, respectively. This means 2022 falls back 10-29
at 02:00, not 10-28 at 01:00. (Thanks to Heba Hamad.)

## Changes to past timestamps

Simplify three Ukraine zones to one, since the post-1970 differences seem to
have been imaginary.  Move Europe/Uzhgorod and Europe/Zaporozhye to 'backzone';
backward-compatibility links still work, albeit with different timestamps before
October 1991.
