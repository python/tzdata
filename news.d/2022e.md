## Briefly:

Jordan and Syria switch from +02/+03 with DST to year-round +03.

## Changes to future timestamps

Jordan and Syria are abandoning the DST regime and are changing to permanent
+03, so they will not fall back from +03 to +02 on 2022-10-28.  (Thanks to
Steffen Thorsen and Issam Al-Zuwairi.)

## Changes to past timestamps

On 1922-01-01 Tijuana adopted standard time at 00:00, not 01:00.

## Changes to past time zone abbreviations and DST flags

The temporary advancement of clocks in central Mexico in summer 1931 is now
treated as daylight saving time, instead of as two changes to standard time.
