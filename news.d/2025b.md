# Version 2025.2
Upstream version 2025b released 2025-03-22T20:40:46+00:00

## Briefly:

New zone for Aysén Region in Chile which moves from -04/-03 to -03.

## Changes to future timestamps

Chile's Aysén Region moves from -04/-03 to -03 year-round, joining Magallanes
Region.  The region will not change its clocks on 2025-04-05 at 24:00, diverging
from America/Santiago and creating a new zone America/Coyhaique.  (Thanks to
Yonathan Dossow.)  Model this as a change to standard offset effective
2025-03-20.

## Changes to past timestamps

Iran switched from +04 to +0330 on 1978-11-10 at 24:00, not at year end.
